Born Rule:
for a quantum state described by a density matric rho and a measurement operator Mk,
the probability of observing outcome k is given by ,
      rho(k)=Trace(Mk*rho)

  for projective measurements,Mk=Pk,
  pk^2=Pk
  sigma(Pk)=I    

  for POVMs,measurement operator Ek satisy:
  Ek>=0,
  sigma(Ek)=is

  **************************************
  Pauli projective measurements(single qubit)

  pauli measurement correspon to project measurements in he eigenbases of the pauli operators

  X=[[0,1],[1,0]]
  Y=[[0,-i],[i,0]]
  Z=[[1,0],[0,-1]]
each pauli operator has 2 projectors corresponding to eigenvalues 1,-1

Strengths:
-->Hardware native and experimentally simple
-->Easy interpretation of outcomes
-->compatible with classical shadow tomography
-->widely supported by quantum toolkits

Trade-offs:
-->requires multiple measurements bases
-->hiher shot budget compared to informationally complet POVMs
-->sensiive to basis misalignment and noise
***********************************************************************************

SIC POVM
a single qubit SIC POVM consists of four rank-1 measurement operators:
           Ek=1/4(|zhik><zhik|)
        
   Strengths:
   -->informational completeness with only four outcomes
   -->rotationally symmetric structure
   --> potentially more sample efficient

   Trade-offs:
   -->requires non standard measurement bases
   -->higher calibration overhead
   -->more complex classical post-processing

measurement model choice

for this work,pauli projective measurements were slected due to:
  1.simplicity and robustness
  2.clear physical interpretation
  3.compatibility with simlator backends
  4.suitability as a baseline for futurre classical shadow methos


operator Validation Checks
numericak completeness was verified for each pauli basis:
P0+P1=I 
all the measurement operators were confirmed to:
be heamitian,posiive semidefinite,sumto indentity within numerical tolerance.
